## Welcome to my Website!
This is where you can know more about me while showcasing what I have currently learned in IT114L.

## How did I accomplish each item in the criteria?
I focused on implementing the core concepts taught instead of focusing on how could I do the design. By building it up from the core concepts it allowed me to think and brainstorm about the design goal of my website along the way. I rarely used core concepts that weren't clear to me as I know I would have troubles in troubleshooting when something goes wrong or conflicts with another styling. For the content, as this is a personal website, I used this opportunity to show off any achievements and information that I want to share to other people.

## Insights that you have gathered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)
I forgot how fun HTML and CSS was to code! While of course it is different from how, for example C++ or Python is coded, the way things just run without the need for waiting for the compiler to finish and such is just relaxing in a way. Also, introducing us to Git and GitHub renewed my love for the terminal and the Command Line Interface. I actually prefer now to do the git commands on the terminal instead of using VS Code.

## Struggles that you have encountered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)
The struggles that I have encountered is probably the way I forgot how to do HTML coding in a basic sense even if it was taught to me back in Junior High School before. This may be due to overlapping programming languages taught to us and my brain can't really keep up. But after a while and due to how everything was taught and presented to us I understood it more now compared to before.

## How you could improve your website in the future
Probably I could implement basic JS code, so that there are true interactive elements now present in the website. I could also add more personal information regarding myself whenever those information are unlocked in the future.

## Other thoughts that might be noteworthy
Git is fun. Especially when used via the terminal or command line interface. It is a good practice area to use command line based text interpreters and help make people comfortable with the CLI as it introduces people to the CLI. It also uses Vim for text editing, which is used widely in developer settings, and can be a useful skill to have in the IT world.
